                  experience.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Potato greens: The tender leaves and stems of potato plants are the star
                 ingredient. These can be obtained by harvesting the greens from fresh potato
                  plants or can be found at specialty grocery stores or farmers' markets.</li>
            <li>Potatoes: Choose medium-sized potatoes that are suitable for cooking. They
                 will add a creamy texture and substance to the dish.</li>
            <li>Aromatics: Onions and garlic are essential aromatics that provide a savory
                 base for the dish.</li>
            <li>Tomatoes: Fresh tomatoes or canned diced tomatoes can be used to add a tangy
                 sweetness and depth of flavor.</li>
            <li>Peppers: Optional peppers like bell peppers, chili peppers, or hot peppers
                 can be added to give the dish a bit of heat and a vibrant kick.</li>
            <li>Protein (optional): You can include protein sources such as meat (chicken,
                 beef, or pork), seafood (shrimp, fish), or plant-based options like beans
                  or tofu, depending on your preference.</li>
            <li>Cooking oil: Use a neutral oil like vegetable oil or olive oil for sautéing
                 the aromatics and cooking the dish.</li>
            <li>Seasonings and spices: Common seasonings include salt, pepper, paprika, cumin,
                 and any additional herbs or spices you enjoy.</li>
        </ul>
        
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Clean and prepare the potato greens: Rinse the potato greens thoroughly under
                 cold water to remove any dirt or debris. Trim off any tough stems or damaged
                  leaves. Chop the greens into manageable pieces and set them aside.</li>
            <li>Prepare the potatoes: Peel the potatoes and cut them into bite-sized cubes.
                 Rinse the potato cubes under cold water to remove excess starch and set them
                  aside.</li>
            <li>Sauté the aromatics: Heat a tablespoon of cooking oil in a large skillet or
                 pot over medium heat. Add finely chopped onions and minced garlic to the hot
                  oil. Sauté until the onions become translucent and fragrant.</li>
            <li>Add tomatoes and peppers: Dice fresh tomatoes and peppers, if using, and add
                 them to the skillet with the sautéed aromatics. Cook for a few minutes until
                  the tomatoes soften and release their juices.</li>
            <li>Cook the potatoes: Add the potato cubes to the skillet and stir them into the
                 mixture. Ensure that the potatoes are well-coated with the flavors from the
                  aromatics, tomatoes, and peppers. You can also add a small amount of water
                   or broth to help cook the potatoes.</li>
            <li>Cook the potato greens: Add the chopped potato greens to the skillet, stirring
                 them into the mixture. The greens will wilt and cook down as they release
                  their moisture. Cover the skillet or pot and let the greens simmer for
                   about 15-20 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender and the greens are
                    cooked to your desired level of doneness.</li>
            <li>Season the dish: Season the potato greens with salt, pepper, and any other
                 desired spices or herbs. Taste and adjust the seasonings to suit your
                  preference.</li>
            <li>Optional protein addition: If desired, you can add cooked meat, seafood,
                 or plant-based protein such as beans or tofu to the dish. Stir them in during
                  the last few minutes of cooking, allowing them to heat through.</li>
            <li>Serve: Potato greens are typically served as a main dish or as a side dish
                 alongside rice, bread, or other grains. Plate the potato greens and garnish
                  with fresh herbs or a drizzle of olive oil, if desired.</li>
        </ol>
